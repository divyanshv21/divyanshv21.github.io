            <h1>My <span>JEE</span> Experience</h1>
            <p>
                I decided to enrol in Resonance in ninth grade for olympiads and as a foundation course for JEE after I
                grew tired of the regular school curriculum. At the time, I had no notion that I would be taking the
                JEE; it was simply a fun alternative. For those who are unaware, JEE Advanced is an entrance exam for
                IITs with an extremely low acceptance rate (0.5%). It consists of Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. I
                nearly enjoyed studying all three disciplines.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to my experience, coaching materials are sufficient for the majority of individuals to pass
                the JEE. Nonetheless, I also utilized reference materials such as HCV in physics, Cengage in
                mathematics, and Solomon and JD Lee in chemistry. They are excellent works, but I would recommend
                reading only one or two of them thoroughly rather than many. Exam tips include answering questions under
                timed conditions and, if you're able to answer a certain type of question readily, increasing the
                difficulty of your problems. If I answer a question correctly the first time, I mark it with a
                checkmark; if I answer it correctly the second or subsequent times, I mark it with a circle; and if I
                don't answer it correctly, I mark it with a question mark. Therefore, when I revise the material again,
                I will only complete the queries with circles and question marks, and the process will continue. Which
                brings me to my next point: revision is of the utmost importance. No matter how much material you have
                covered, you cannot perform well on this exam if you have not reviewed it.
            </p>

                JEE is all about discipline, effort, and perseverance. Whoever does not give up will ultimately triumph.
                This paper directly or indirectly assesses one's capacity to work in high-pressure environments, rise
                each morning and work towards an objective, and maintain motivation.It is vital to continue asking
                questions. Curiosity has its own inherent purpose. When contemplating the mysteries of eternity, of
                life, and of the wondrous structure of reality, one cannot help but feel astonishment. It is sufficient
                to seek daily comprehension of a small portion of this enigma.
